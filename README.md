# 🎮 Unity 2D RPG – Applied Learning Repository

This repository contains my project work and implementation from the  
**“The Ultimate Guide to Creating an RPG Game in Unity 6”** course on Udemy.

Rather than simply following along passively, this project reflects structured practice, iteration, refactoring, and system-level thinking — approaching the course as a real development environment rather than a checklist exercise.

---

## 🧠 Overview

- **Engine:** Unity 6  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Project Type:** 2D RPG  
- **Focus Areas:** Gameplay systems, architecture, modular design, UI, combat systems  

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate applied learning and clean engineering practices within a game development context.

## 🚀 Core Systems Implemented

### 🎯 Gameplay Systems
- Finite State Machines (player & enemy)
- Player movement and input handling
- Enemy AI and behaviour states
- Combat systems with hit detection & damage logic
- Character stats and progression systems

### 🎒 RPG Mechanics
- Inventory system
- Equipment system
- Skill tree structure
- Item management using ScriptableObjects
- Save & load system

### 🎨 Visual & World Systems
- Tilemap-based level design
- Parallax backgrounds
- Animator controllers & blend trees
- 2D camera setup
- UI elements (health bars, menus, inventory screens)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Unity 6
- C#
- Unity New Input System
- ScriptableObjects
- Unity Animator
- 2D Physics & Tilemap tools

### Structure Philosophy

- Scripts organised by domain (Player, UI, Inventory, etc.)
- Systems separated for readability and scalability
- Commit history reflects iterative improvements and refactoring

---

## 📈 Skills Demonstrated

- Object-Oriented Programming
- State Machine implementation
- Modular system design
- Clean code structuring
- Iterative refactoring
- Version control discipline
- Game architecture fundamentals
- Translating gameplay concepts into maintainable code

---

## 💡 What Makes This Repository Valuable

This project demonstrates:

- The ability to build interconnected gameplay systems
- Understanding of scalable architecture within Unity
- Comfort working with larger, multi-system projects
- Intentional code organisation rather than prototype-level scripting
- Continuous improvement and refinement over time

---

## 🔍 Recruiter Notes

This repository is part of my broader development journey focusing on:

- C# architecture and clean coding principles
- Gameplay systems engineering
- Structured learning and skill progression
- Applying software development best practices within game development

I treat courses as structured environments to strengthen professional-level skills rather than simple tutorial exercises.

---

## 🏁 Future Improvements

- Expand enemy behaviours
- Improve game feel & feedback systems
- Performance optimisation
- Additional UI polish
- Build deployment for Web / Desktop
